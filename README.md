# About

This mod attempts to uphold peace in pregame.
Not by preventing players from attacking each other,
but by allowing **diplomacy** to take place.

Currently, if you enter the room within which the enemy tech point lies in pregame,
you will take damage, and eventually, perish.

How is one supposed to create peace and prosperity, when
any attempt at diplomacy and communication is outright forbidden?

This modification attempts to fix this problem.

# What it does

Instead of killing all enemies in the room within which the tech point is,
only enemies within 2 meters of the command structure are killed.

To prevent the kharaa from sabotaging the humans by creating a massive wall around the CC,
marines can while in pregame enter the CC from any possible position. This means you can
initiate the log-in, run away, and still successfully enter it (unless you die of course).
